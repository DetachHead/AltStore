Also, keep in mind that uYou+ is a modified version of uYou, DO NOT bother MiRO92 with problems unrelated to uYou!!!\n- iSponsorBlock: the modified time doesn't show up in the seek bar.\n- YTUHD: Stuttering on 4K videos (sometimes).\n- YouPiP (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the speedup-bug as described here. The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable Legacy PiP is a workaround. Note that Legacy PiP removes UHD quality and breaks the default video quality feature of uYou. Use it at your own risk.",
