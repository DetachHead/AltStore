Plus many, many other testers. \n\n Features:\n Cercube no ads: make sure you log in to Cercube using a verified account.\n- SponsorBlock: skip sponsor ads inside videos.\n- YTUHD: unlock VP9 codec, which also enables 1440 & 2140p quality.\n- YTClassicVideoQuality: brings back the original video quality selector.\n- YouAreThere: Disable "Video paused. Continue watching?" popup when you play a long video. n\- YouPiP: Enable native PiP in YouTube app. \n- YTNoHoverCards: allows creator End screens (thumbnails) to appear at the end of videos. \n- YTNoShorts: remove Shorts in Home tab. You still can watch Shorts in the Shorts tab, or search for #shorts in the search bar. \n\n Known issues:\n- Cercube logo & YouTube logo may not appear in the top bar. \n- YouPiP: due to Apple's fault, speed-up bug still happens sometimes. Workaround: use Legacy PiP, not recommend unless you're facing the speed-up bug. \n- iSponsorBlock: segments color doesn't show up in the seek bar. Workaround: downgrade to v16.20.5. \n- YTUHD may not work for some reasons. \n- Does not work on iOS 12 and below.      "name": "Better Cercube",
