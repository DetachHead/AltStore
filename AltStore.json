      "localizedDescription": "Credits: KEEP THE CREDITS IF YOU WANT TO RE-UP MY IPA! \n- Alfhaily for Cercube.\n- Galactic-Dev for the original iSponsorBlock, @Luewii for his fork of iSponsorBlock (which works in jailed mode).\n- PoomSmart for YTUHD and YTClassicVideoQuality.\n- Julioverne for removing Cercube ads.\n- CrazyMind90 for YTDisableUglySuggestions.\n- Al4ise for Azule - a tool used to inject jailbreak tweaks into jailed iOS apps! \n- Huge thanks to u/el_zari, the best tester I ever worked with. Plus many, many other testers. \n\n Features:\n CercubeNoAds: make sure you log in to Cercube first.\n- SponsorBlock: skip sponsor ads inside video.\n- YTUHD: unlock 1440 & 2140p quality.\n- YTClassicVideoQuality: brings back the original video quality selector.\n- YTDisableUglySuggestions: remove suggested videos that show up as thumbnails at the end of some Youtube videos. \n\n Known issues:\n- Does not work on iOS 12 and below because iSponsorBlock requires iOS 13+.\n- iSponsorBlock: on YouTube v16.22.5, modified time doesn't show up in the videos progress bar.\n- YTUHD may not work. Watching high-quality video (1440p+) may causing battery drain/laggy/hot.\n- Install the iPA using Filza won't work. Not sure why you need the iPA if you're jailbroken, though...",      "name": "Better Cercube",
