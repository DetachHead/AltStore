RESPECT THE DEVELOPER!!!\n\n* [**Alfhaily**](https://twitter.com/freemanrepo) for Cercube.\n* [**Galactic-Dev**](https://github.com/Galactic-Dev) for the original iSponsorBlock, [**Luewii**](https://github.com/Luewii/iSponsorBlock) for his fork of iSponsorBlock (which works in jailed mode).\n* [**PoomSmart**](https://twitter.com/PoomSmart) for YTUHD and YTClassicVideoQuality.\n* [**Julioverne**](https://twitter.com/iJulioVerne) for removing Cercube ads.\n* [**CrazyMind90**](https://twitter.com/CrazyMind90) for YTDisableUglySuggestions.\n* [**Al4ise**](https://github.com/Al4ise) for [**Azule**](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule). A tool used to inject jailbreak tweaks into jailed iOS apps! Donâ€™t scary, it's very easy to use ðŸ˜‰\n* Huge thanks to [**u/el\\_zari**](https://www.reddit.com/user/el_zari/), the best tester ever. Plus many, many other testers. Thank you for your support!\n\n# Features:\n\n* **CercubeNoAds**: make sure you log in to Cercube first.\n* **SponsorBlock:** skip sponsor ads inside video.\n* **YTUHD:** unlock 1440 & 2140p quality.\n* **YTClassicVideoQuality:** brings back the original video quality selector.\n* **YTDisableUglySuggestions:** remove suggested videos that show up as thumbnails at the end of some Youtube videos.\n* Demo: [iSponsorBlock](https://i.imgur.com/Y9T2keq.jpg); [CercubeNoAds](https://i.imgur.com/97G61wC.jpg); [YTUHD](https://i.imgur.com/I5fYqlL.jpg)\n\n# Known issues:\n\n* Does not work on iOS 12 and below because iSponsorBlock requires iOS 13+.\n* iSponsorBlock: on YouTube v16.22.5, modified time doesn't show up in the videos progress bar.\n* ~~Cast to TV doesnâ€˜t work. Please use \"~~**~~Link with TV code~~**~~\"~~ Fixed!\n* YTUHD may not work. Watching high-quality video (1440p+) may causing battery drain/laggy/hot.\n* [This glitch](https://m.imgur.com/jWC4LJ2?r) on the Home tab. Simply refresh the Home tab to fix it.\n* Install the iPA using Filza won't work. Not sure why you need the iPA if you're jailbroken, though...",
